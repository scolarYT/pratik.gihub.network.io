## Projects Overview

### 1. **Router Configuration**
- **Objective:** Configured and optimized routers to facilitate inter-network communication.
- **Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Implemented static and dynamic routing protocols.
  - Verified routing tables and ensured packet delivery across subnets.
  - Focused on efficient route selection for optimized performance.

### 2. **Switch Configuration**
- **Objective:** Configured Layer 2 switches for VLAN segmentation and improved network efficiency.
- **Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Created multiple VLANs for logical network segmentation.
  - Enabled trunk ports to facilitate inter-VLAN communication.
  - Tested STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) to prevent loops in the network.

### 3. **BGP Network Configuration**
- **Objective:** Designed and implemented a Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) network for scalability.
- **Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Configured autonomous systems (AS) for inter-domain routing.
  - Enabled route filtering for efficient routing between networks.
  - Focused on scalability and reduced latency across large-scale networks.

### 4. **OSPF Network Configuration**
- **Objective:** Built a scalable and efficient network using the Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) protocol.
- **Tools Used:** Cisco Packet Tracer.
- **Key Highlights:**
  - Configured multiple routers in a hierarchical OSPF design.
  - Verified successful neighbor relationships and route propagation.
  - Optimized network convergence times using OSPF areas.
